you scavenge dirt -> get some mud pieces & clay pieces & brick fragment 
-> make a clay ingot mold (16 brick fragment for a brick, add 1 clay and 1 ingot in crafting menu to make a clay ingot mold (brick not consumed)) 
-> dry it (hopefully a way to place it down or just hang it on a tree) -> put mud inside the mold to make mud bricks 
-> cost 1 point of "power of friendship" to turn 4 mud bricks in crafting menu into a mud boiler
